=== Enhancement Added: Find by close words (fuzzy searching) and find by tags

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=find]

---

==== Justification

Users may sometimes key commands too quickly or forget the names of their contacts.
This enhancement allows them to find contacts by close name words or by tags previously assigned to make finding contacts in the Rolodex a lot easier.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=findClose]
//TODO: Add findClose section in Developer Guide (Implementation & Design Considerations See undoredo for example)

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Sortable parameters in commands augmenting list view
