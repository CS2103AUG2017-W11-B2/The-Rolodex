== Project: Rolodex

include::../../README.adoc[tag=applicationDescription]

*Code contributed*: https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/pulse[Pulse]

=== Enhancement Added: Find by close words (fuzzy searching) and find by tags

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=find]

---

==== Justification

Users may sometimes key commands too quickly or forget the names of their contacts.
This enhancement allows them to find contacts by close name words or by tags previously assigned to make finding contacts in the Rolodex a lot easier.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=findClose]
//TODO: Add findClose section in Developer Guide (Implementation & Design Considerations See undoredo for example)

---

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=list]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=find]

---

==== Justification

Users may sometimes have too many contacts in a listing.
This enhancement allows them to find contacts quickly by sorting the displayed list of persons.
Users can operate on a sorted list for longer displayed lists via `list` or `find` command.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=sorting]

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Opening a new and separate Rolodex

To allow users to operate on a different data set for different purposes.
